A demo project.


## design

This project can be broken down into the following components:

- [directory structures following a standard](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
- Multi-stage Docker Build for lightweight distribution
- Embedding a frontend with the builtin embed package

The `embed` package does not allow parent directory relative paths, so the `embed.go` file at the root is where the import occurs to match the `web/` directory structure standard.

For `go.mod` you can run `go get ...` at the root to pull in dependencies, allowing you to build all sub-directory components.  You can also update `go/mod` by running `go get -u ... && go mod tidy`.

The separated `cmd/` structure allows you to create multiple binaries off the same library components, which could be used to separate functionality into `X/` following the directory standards making for very modular coding that works for monolithic and independent binaries.

We've included `cmd/integration` to demonstrate an independent integration testing package, versioned alongside the project.  _The only potential concern would be if multiple binaries with separate functionality were created, in which case you might create an `cmd/*/integration/` directory structure, and change the Dockerfile build instructions as needed._

The root `Dockerfile` produces a final self-contained image with the `cmd/beam` binary and both unit and integration tests, allowing you to run the tests on itself, giving you excellent synchronized versioning capabilities.

Routing demonstrates hard-coded JSON response at `/health`, dynamic responses behind `/api`, template responses at `/users` and `/services`, and finally an embedded file-based front-end when no explicitly registered routes match, including the index, _which could eventually be turned into a REACT SPA._


## instructions

**Go is a cross platform compiled language, which means it produces a binary, so for local development you can just run the code without containerization, otherwise every change will require you to recompile the binary.**

Start at the root and install dependencies leveraging go mod:

	go get ...

Quick test and build from `cmd/beam`:

	go test -v
	go build
	./beam

_Easily check status from [`/health`](http://localhost:3000/health)._


### postgresql

For local development you may need to [enable ssl](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ssl-tcp.html) or change the connection string to explicitly disable it (eg. `postgres://username:password@localhost/db_name?sslmode=disable`).


### docker

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) produces a production scratch container with the beam binary, test binary, and integration binary.

This means the docker image is self-contained and can prove that its own code works by running its own unit tests, or running integration tests pointed at itself.

To build the image and tag by git hash:

	docker build . -t beam:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

_We'll assume the `test` tag for shorter subsequent commands._

Run the unit testsã€€from the test binary within the container:

	docker run --rm beam:test /go/bin/beam.test -test.v

Run the benchmarks from the test binary within the container:

	docker run --rm beam:test /go/bin/beam.test -test.v -test.run=X -test.benchtime=10s -test.benchmem -test.bench=.

Run the default command and access it from [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/):

	docker run --rm beam:test

Run the integration tests from the integration binary within the container, and point at the local running copy:

	docker run --rm -e "ADDRESS=http://localhost:3000/" beam:test go/bin/integration

_The majority of these commands can be fully automated from a CICD system, and the outputs can be used to make decisions such as failing unit tests stops before deployment, failing integration tests in one environment prevents promotion to the next environment, and so on..._

Further, anyone should be able to run the integration command against any environment they have access to, allowing you to rapidly validate whether an environment is functioning correctly.


## todo

Working on adding functionality:

- Try moving database abstraction to `/pkg/postgres`
	- _verify logging works as intended (eg. force a syntax error), and I don't need to set logger configuration in the package._
	- Move `XStorage` structures into this package

- add `Token` struct, `TokenHandler` and `TokenStorage` to abstract token logic.

- Figure out how to combine token and user storage logic behind Auth structure to deal with token creation and selection...

- replace `/login` with `/oauth/token`
	- accept both Basic and Bearer
		- _Expect Refresh Token if Bearer_
	- If authentication is successful and no refresh token exists create one
	- Respond with json `refresh_token` & `access_token`
	- Add brute force protection mechanism
		- _add failed login counter and failed login timestamp to table_
		- _add exponential backoff condition based on counter & timestamp_
		- _add query to update counter & timestamp on failed login attempt_
		- _on successful login, reset counter & timestamp_

- add `/oauth/revoke`
	- access Bearer **refresh** token to delete from database

- add `/services` and `/users` routes using the `html/template` stdlib package to render a table response
	- _this is purely to demonstrate server-side rendering._

- revisit `auth.go` by adding jwt validation wrapper
	- _if no keypair is provided the project should generate one_
	- _We can add a `/public.key` route to be used by third parties for JWT validation._

- break out business logic from `cmd/beam` into `pkg/api` to demonstrate modular construction

- define tests in `cmd/integration`
	- _accept `ADDRESS` and `CREDENTIALS` env vars_
		- _allows it to be run against any environment_
		- _can use predefined credentials for testing_
			- we may want to support different tiers of credentials (eg. to validate users with varying permission levels)
	- Cleanup cycle should be executed both pre and post execution
		- _pre-cleanup avoids canceled tests with leftover/orphaned resources_

- begin writing reactjs into main.js to produce SPA UI


## temporary commands

Curl to create a user:

	curl -X POST -d "username=username&email=user@gmail.com&password=password" http://localhost:3000/register

Can collect a refresh token:

	REFRESH_TOKEN=$(curl -X POST -u username:password http://localhost:3000/login 2> /dev/null)

Can send that refresh token to get an access token:

	ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl -h "Authorization: Refresh $REFRESH_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/oauth/token)

Can create a service using that access token:

	curl -X POST -h "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/service -d '{"name":"","technology":"go","poc":"user@email.com"}'

_Substitute with username and password stored in the database or it will fail with 401._


# refrences

- [
Refresh Tokens
](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/making-authenticated-requests/refreshing-an-access-token/)

Sample json response from Refresh Tokens reference:

	{
	  "access_token": "BWjcyMzY3ZDhiNmJkNTY",
	  "refresh_token": "Srq2NjM5NzA2OWJjuE7c",
	  "token_type": "Bearer",
	  "expires": 3600
	}

_Not sure if passing expires matters, since the service has to detect expired tokens from 401 response anyways._
